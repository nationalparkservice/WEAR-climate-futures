WEAR-climate-futures

#Introduction
This is code used to create climate future materials for the WEAR RSS. It combines data and information from https://northernclimatereports.org/ (NCR) and the output from the AKR-climate-futures repository. This project will not provide long-term historical trends because LT datasets have biases in this area due to limitated stations. 

#Steps for running scripts
1. Run climate futures for each of the WEAR parks using the AKR-climate-futures repository. (CAKR, NOAT, KOVA)
2. Pull data from NCR
